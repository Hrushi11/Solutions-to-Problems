# TensorFlow-GPU-Problem
The common problem - GPU exists but is not detected by the JupyterNotebook

To visit the Jupyter notebook -> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Hrushi11/TensorFlow-GPU-Problem/HEAD) <br>

Some of the devices that have succesfull running of TensorFlow version 2.0, still show GPU not visible. 
This Juputer Notebook works on the same problem, more importantly how to solve the problem.
